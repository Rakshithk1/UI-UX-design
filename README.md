# UI-UX-design
"UI/UX design samples from my Coursera course, including case studies, wireframes, and prototypes demonstrating my journey in user-centered design."

In this course I had to complete 4 modules in total.
And in the first module I learnt hoow to empathize with the users to understand their needs and pain points. 
Create empathy maps, personas and users stories.
develop problem statements.
Conduct competitive audits.

And in next module, I have learnt how to build wireframes annd Low-fedility prototypes. 
First, I had to create an paper wireframe  and then the digital wireframe using Figma.
In this module, I was able to develop the goal statement, create story board, understand the difference between the low fedility and the high-fedlity designs.

The third modules tought me to plan a UX research stuudy, including the project backkground, reasearch goals, questions, methoodology and scripts.
And in the foouth module, I got learn to build mockups and  high fedilty prototypes in Figma. 
Learn how to hand off finished design projects to the engineering teams.

In the next module, I learnt to apply each step of the UX design thinking framework which is empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test to create a resposive website.
I had also, joined the UI/UX communities and have designed some high fedility design using figma.

Here are the designs which I have created.
